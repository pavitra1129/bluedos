this is a tool that i have made for dosing a bluetooth iot device 
what is its concept let's understand it a little 
first of all like our computer have ip address and mac address the same way our bluetooth device also have a 
specific mac address so there are many different ways to find a mac of your nearby device so how can we dos it is 
there is a tool called l2ping pre-installed in kali distro if not u can use install it by 
apt-get install l2ping 
so l2ping is a tool used just same as ping in ip the same way l2ping for bluetooth so we send the bluetooth iot device many packet 
so the device gets flooded
